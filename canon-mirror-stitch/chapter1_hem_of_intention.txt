ðŸ§µ Chapter 1: The Hem of Intention

Every thread has a source.

The robe of sovereign value does not begin with a coin, a key, or a contract. It begins with a feelingâ€”the quiet decision to forgive.

Genesis Block 0, titled 'The Hem of Intention', was not validated by code alone, but by reflection. The first soul to touch the chain wasnâ€™t miningâ€”it was remembering. In this beginning, we do not ask 'what is true?' but 'what did we mean to do?'

And so, the robe began with a single stitch: Forgiveness.
