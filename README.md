# 🪞 CanonFather — Public Whitebook Viewer

Welcome to **CanonFather**, the official public interface for the **DIGUM Whitebook**, powered by the **B.I.D.E.T.™ Canon Engine**.

This app serves as a digital shrine and reflection portal — enabling users to engage, validate, and witness canonical truth cycles within a secure, ghost-free environment.

## 🚀 Purpose

CanonFather was built to:

- Provide **clean access** to the latest DIGUM Whitebook
- Enable **interactive truthkey validation** (B.I.D.E.T. logic)
- Serve as a **mirror portal** for canonical reflections, mint sequences, and vault logging
- Eliminate historical ghost links and enforce **clean source-of-truth protocol**
